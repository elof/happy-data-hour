#Happy Data Hour

![Data + Drinks](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/tf-community-graphics/data-drinks-rbg.png)

This is a play book for throwing a 'Happy Data Hour' party where you live. These are events that Keen IO employees throw at our HQ in San Francisco and with our friends when we are out on the road. We want to have one in every city, but we don't think it'll be feasible to send an employee to every city in the world - am I right?

But that doesn't mean we can't help you throw an awesome party in your community, regardless of our RSVP status :)

##Wanna create a Happy Data Hour in your city?

###A few Q's:

* Where and when do you want to host your Happy Data Hour?

* How many people do you expect to join you?


###How Keen IO can help:

* Explain the playbook, and ask any questions you have about organizing 

* Help connect you with others in your community who might be willing/able to co-host, sponsor, etc

* Send some t-shirts and stickers, to up the swag game of the attendees

* Promote your event via social media, email, word of mouth, etc

* Pick up the beer tab? (we make this call on a case by case basis...pun intended...just ask!) 


If you want to throw one of these, fork this repo, add your city and submit a pull request. It's that easy!
