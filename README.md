== Happy Data Hour

![Data + Drinks](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/tf-community-graphics/data+drinks.png)

This is a play book for throwing a 'Happy Data Hour' party where you live. These are event's that Keen IO employees throw at our HQ in San Francisco and with our friends when we are out on the road. We want to have one in every city, but we can't always send an actually employee out.

That doesn't mean we can't help you throw an awesome party and buy you guys some beers :)

Some questions we have:

* Where and when do you want to host your Happy Data Hour?

* How many people do you expect to join you?


How Keen IO can help:

* Promote via social media

* Mail you some tshirts and stickers

* Pick up the beer tab

If you want to throw one of these, fork this repo, add your city and submit a pull request.
